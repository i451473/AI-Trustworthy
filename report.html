</dl></header><main class="section"><p><strong>Background</strong>  <br />The Customer Support Dashboard was introduced in April 2025 to assist 12 support agents in the Netherlands office with monitoring ticket resolution times and customer satisfaction scores. Its primary goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the customer support team.</p>
<p><strong>Key Observations</strong>  <br />Since the dashboard’s launch, average ticket resolution time has improved significantly, decreasing from 48 hours to 32 hours. Customer satisfaction (CSAT) also rose from 76% to 84% in Q3. Agents highlighted that access to real-time data enabled them to better prioritize urgent tickets. Despite these benefits, three agents reported that the dashboard experiences slow loading times during peak hours (10:00–12:00 CET).</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>  <br />The dashboard currently faces two main issues. First, there is a 15-minute delay in data refresh, which sometimes results in outdated information being displayed. Second, the absence of a mobile version restricts agents’ ability to access the dashboard while working remotely.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>  <br />To address these challenges and further improve performance, it is recommended to reduce the data refresh interval to 5 minutes and to start developing a mobile-friendly version for release in Q1 2026. These enhancements are expected to boost both efficiency and user satisfaction among support agents.<br /><br /><strong>Trust Score: Very Trustworthy</strong> (Based on source validation and consistency across runs)<br />Source Validation: High | Consistency: High<br /><br />[<br />Transparency &amp; Accountability:<br /><br />This summary and recommendations were generated by AI.<br />Based only on the uploaded document: report.md.<br />This AI works best with clear, structured reports.
