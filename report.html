            <p><strong>Performance Review Summary: Customer Support Dashboard (Q3 2025)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>  <br />The Customer Support Dashboard, introduced in April 2025, serves 12 support agents in the Netherlands office by enabling them to monitor ticket resolution times and customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores.</p>
<p><strong>Key Observations</strong>  <br />Since the dashboard’s implementation, average ticket resolution time has significantly decreased from 48 to 32 hours, and CSAT has improved from 76% to 84% in Q3. Agents attribute these improvements to the availability of real-time data, which aids in prioritizing urgent tickets. Despite these benefits, three agents reported slow dashboard loading during peak hours (10:00–12:00 CET).</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>  <br />The dashboard currently experiences a 15-minute data refresh delay, occasionally resulting in outdated information being displayed. Additionally, the absence of a mobile version restricts agents’ access during remote work situations.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>  <br />To address these issues, it is recommended to reduce the data refresh interval to 5 minutes and initiate development of a mobile-friendly version in Q1 2026. These enhancements are anticipated to further boost agent efficiency and user satisfaction.</p>
