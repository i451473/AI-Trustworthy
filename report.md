# Performance Review: Customer Support Dashboard (Q3 2025)

## Background  
The Customer Support Dashboard was launched in April 2025 to help agents track ticket resolution times and customer satisfaction scores. The tool is used by 12 support agents across the Netherlands office.

## Key Observations  
- Average resolution time dropped from 48 hours to 32 hours after the dashboard launch.  
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT) increased from 76% to 84% in Q3.  
- Agents reported that real-time data helped them prioritize urgent tickets.  
- However, 3 agents noted that the dashboard loads slowly during peak hours (10:00–12:00 CET).

## Challenges  
- The system sometimes shows outdated data due to a 15-minute refresh delay.  
- No mobile version is available, which limits access during remote work.

## Recommendation  
Improve dashboard performance by reducing data refresh time to 5 minutes and begin planning a mobile-friendly version for Q1 2026. These changes are expected to further increase efficiency and user satisfaction.
